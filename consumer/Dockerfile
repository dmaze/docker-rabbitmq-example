# 'docker-compose build' from the parent directory will build this.

# To build this by hand, cd into the "consumer" directory and run
# 'docker build -t consumer .', and then you can manually run
# 'docker run --rm -e AMQP_URL=... consumer' to run it.

# Our requirements are minimal, but it's good practice to install them
# first.  Put things that change less often towards the top of the
# Dockerfile.  Then if you need to rebuild the images, Docker will
# start running partway through the Dockerfile and skip over the steps
# where nothing's changed.

# It's only a single file.  It has to be in the same directory as the
# Dockerfile, or a subdirectory, but not a parent or sibling.
COPY consumer.py .

# When you just 'docker run publisher' with no command afterwards,
